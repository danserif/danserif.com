									This inaugural issue features some bad news <span class="opacity-light">(a fractured foot and redundancy)</span> plus some good news
									<span class="opacity-light">(a healed foot, new work, side projects, vibe coding, ASCII, fonts, and a new camera).</span>
								</p>
								<p class="opacity-dark">//</p>
								<p>
									According to thousands of newsletter influencers I’m supposed to start this first email off with a positive introduction about what you’ll get below
									<span class="opacity-light">(and in your inbox in the future).</span> Not only am I not following that advice <span class="opacity-light">(fractured foot, redundancy, etc.),</span> I’m only just getting
									around to sending a newsletter many months after first asking you all to sign up. Best practice is to send something straight away. My bad. I tried to get around this by asking people to sign up again
									last week, so a few of you will be impressed to get this email right away!
								</p>
								<p>In hindsight, I should have set expectations more clearly. When I said my newsletter would be “infrequent”, I was thinking maybe once a quarter. It’s now shaping up to be an annual thing.</p>
								<p>
									Despite the best intentions of sending a newsletter the minute I set it up, I’m instead cutting it fine and getting one out before the end of the year. Insert
									<span class="opacity-light">indiana-jones.gif</span> of him sliding under the door.
								</p>
								<p>
									And finally, the last bit of advice from the influencers was to write something short and snappy… I haven’t done that. My justification is I’m fighting the constant stream of snack-sized-slop and
									instead have written a long update, so get a beverage and settle in. Somehow, the fracturing of my foot also provides an appropriate title for this email. It’s a fractured list of things from the year.

									Earlier this year I took a tumble and fractured my foot. It had been a very long time since I’d broken a bone, and that was only a couple fingers playing cricket. I’d got off lightly growing up when it
									comes to casts and slings, so I wasn’t well prepared for what was ahead. Dealing with a cast in my 40s <span class="opacity-light">(and over summer)</span> was not ideal, but spoiler alert, I’m fine.
									People break bones and end up in a lot more discomfort than what I experienced, so all things considered I got lucky.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first thing everyone asked me was “what happened” and if I was doing anything exciting… the short answer is, no. I wasn’t skateboarding, I was visiting a good friend to learn about coffee. He’d
									setup his outdoor table with a wonderful arrangement of coffee gadgets and various beans to taste. I got distracted coming down the stairs to his coffee wonderland, I missed the last few steps onto the
									deck and before I realised what had happened I was on my back. At first I thought I’d been knocked out as I felt very nauseous. Turns out (as my doctor informed me later) that was my body trying to hide
									the pain in my foot! Part shock, and part preoccupied by coffee, I didn’t realise how bad it was, so I stayed and nursed my foot with an icepack. Enjoying the coffee and conversation, it was only when I
									went to stand up to leave I noticed I couldn’t put any weight on my foot. Also, when I took my sandal off, my foot pointed in the wrong direction!
								</p>
								<p>
									I probably should have gone straight to the hospital, because after getting an x-ray, it was confirmed my foot was broken and I needed a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFJXRoozDtw/">cast</a>. Then
									I was sent home with crutches, some powerful painkillers, and strict instructions not to stand on my foot and to keep it raised as much as possible.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the highlights of what was a mostly grim/boring time waiting for my foot to heal was getting a ride on a robotic chair to help me out of my house! If you’re familiar with Wellington, you’ll know
									it has many steep sections with too many steps. I live in one of said sections, and it was a challenge to get in and out. 22 steps in my case with a couple of paths splitting them up. They’d never been
									a problem previously, but kept me pretty much housebound while I healed. To get to one of the appointments at the fracture clinic in the hospital, I was helpfully strapped to the chair and it climbed up
									the steps with a paramedic guiding it. Felt very futuristic. It was kind of like a wheel chair with tank tracks. I unfortunately didn’t get a photo, but I did get one of my
									<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFjqHPmp77Y/">scooter</a> I used to zoom around.
								</p>
								<p class="opacity-dark">//</p>
								<p>
									Before I fractured my foot, a few days earlier I’d started the year with news that the startup I was working at was doing a round of redundancies. Not great, but credit where it’s due: it wasn’t before
									Christmas.
								</p>
								<p>
									Having experienced it before, I tried to make light of this one and rebrand it as a <span class="opacity-light">RedunDANcy.</span> Axiom no longer needed a Dan, but that just meant I was free to provide
									<span class="opacity-light">RedunDANcy</span> to other businesses needing design. Laughter is the best medicine.
								</p>
								<p>
									There’s no perfect time to get made redundant, or break a bone, so I tried to make the best of it. However, they say bad things happen in threes, so to complete the trifecta, Ada got sick and was on
									rest orders from the vet, which is a challenging thing for an active dog that loves the beach! We weren’t able to get to the bottom of what was wrong, but it was possibly a problem with a nerve or disc
									in her spine. Fortunately she’s doing better now after exhausting our pet insurance.
								</p>
								<p class="opacity-dark">//</p>
								<p>
									While I was laid up waiting for the foot to heal I tried to use the time productively to think about my future. Having that time ended up being for the best, as I made some decisions about what I wanted
									to do next…

								<p>A few folks have asked what I’ve been up to since leaving <a href="/archiving/axiom/">Axiom</a>. The TL;DR <span class="opacity-light">(previously posted on LinkedIn):</span></p>
								<p>I’ve been helping a couple of startups out under the name DaaS <span class="opacity">(Graphics)</span> aka Dan as a Service. Having a blast. I’m fully booked polishing pixels and arranging ASCII.</p>
								<p>Most recently I’ve been working with the talented team at <a href="https://loopholelabs.io">Loophole Labs</a>. They’re getting up to some seriously impressive stuff.</p>
								<p>
									It’s been loads of fun to work on their identity, branding, and design. Getting to define so much from scratch has been a unique and inspiring opportunity. Also, bonus points for getting to play with a
									new font (<a href="https://commitmono.com">Commit Mono</a>), and get up to my same antics with glyphs and grids.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thus far I’ve been creating a design system for both Loophole Labs and Architect, their console application. One of the more interesting details is the logo marks can be easily typed out
									<span class="opacity-light">{∞}</span> <span class="opacity-dark">+</span> <span class="opacity-light">/~\</span> as part of a flexible identity that’ll work in a CLI or on a t-shirt.
								</p>
								<p>
									ICYMI you can see some of this work in these posts:

								<p>
									While AI continues to come for everything in its path, it still hasn’t quite got to ASCII <span class="opacity-light">(and me).</span> So I’m still designing, and working on some fun new projects. DaaS
									<span class="opacity-light">(Graphics)</span> ended up being a nice excuse to define some personal branding to use across my sites and newsletter. Pixels, mono fonts, ASCII, lists, black<span
										class="opacity"
										>/</span
									>white, and highlighter lime<span class="opacity">/</span>yellow.
								</p>
								<p>
									What started as me making a joke, DaaS <span class="opacity-light">(Dan as a Service)</span> has ended up how I’m going to work with companies<span class="opacity">/</span>clients for the foreseeable. I
									worked on a site whilst the foot healed, but was fortunate to have people I’ve previously worked with referring me before I was able to launch it, so I was able to jump straight into several
									opportunities as I got back on my feet.

									After spending a significant time looking at foundry sites throughout my career, and then making a neue one for <a href="https://klim.co.nz">Klim</a>, I took an overdue break from fonts. It’s been five
									years now since I worked on the site with my mate <a href="https://zakbrown.co">Zak</a> and a lot has changed. Foundry sites have become similar, and there’s so many fonts to catch up on!
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the last few years I’ve been using various mono typefaces for work/clients including <a href="https://usgraphics.com/products/berkeley-mono">Berkeley Mono</a>,
									<a href="https://commitmono.com">Commit Mono</a>, and <a href="https://klim.co.nz/fonts/pitch-sans/">Pitch Sans</a>, as well as some old faithfuls
									<a href="https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/">Söhne</a> and <a href="https://klim.co.nz/collections/untitled/">Untitled</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some years I’ve ended up working at places where I’d use the same font. As someone who loves typography, thats often been a challenge, so I’m back looking for new fonts, and new ways to use existing
									fonts. A lot of this work has been ASCII and pushing how far I can use just a typeface <span class="opacity-light">(and glyphs)</span> as that main element in the graphic language of the brands I’ve
									worked with.
								</p>
								<p>
									For DaaS <span class="opacity-light">(Graphics)</span> I’ve been using <a href="https://departuremono.com">Departure Mono</a> <span class="opacity-light">(a monospace pixel font),</span> along with
									<a href="https://foundry.basement.studio/fonts/adhesion">Adhesion</a> <span class="opacity-light">(a blackletter pixel font),</span> and <a href="https://klim.co.nz/fonts/die-grotesk/">Die Grotesk</a>
									<span class="opacity-light">(Klim Type Foundry’s Helvetica).</span> At some point, I’ll ship a site and you’ll see more than just a few GIFs on LinkedIn or Twitter.
								</p>
								<p>
									My list of fonts I want to buy<span class="opacity">/</span>use has got pretty unmanageable this year as I’ve gotten back into following foundries more closely. There’s so many great fonts and so little
									time. Some at the top of the list to use are <a href="https://www.frostype.xyz/typeface/scenik-mono">Scenik Mono</a>, <a href="https://www.frostype.xyz/typeface/system-grotesk">System</a>, and
									<a href="https://www.frostype.xyz/typeface/system-mono">System Mono</a>
									from Frost Type, <a href="https://system.mass-driver.com">MD System</a> <span class="opacity-light">(confusingly another named System, but also not a system font),</span>
									<a href="https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-thermochrome/">MD Thermochrome</a>, and <a href="https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-io/">MD IO</a> from Mass Driver;
									<a href="https://foundry.gardedesign.se/typefaces/gd-octio">GD Octio</a> and <a href="https://foundry.gardedesign.se/typefaces/gd-gaio">GD Gaio</a> from GD Foundry; and
									<a href="https://order.design/otf/vanity">Vanity</a> and <a href="https://order.design/otf/sita">Sita</a> from Order.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you have other fonts you think I’ll like, send me an email. I’m collecting <a href="https://www.cosmos.so/danserif/mono">mono fonts</a> and
									<a href="https://www.cosmos.so/danserif/typography">typographic</a> inspiration on <a href="https://www.cosmos.so/danserif">Cosmos</a>, and have been thinking of doing some sort of font related side
									project. Speaking of side projects…

								<p>SIDE PROJECTS</p>

									I’ve been working on a couple of vibe coded apps this year as a way to keep up with the insanity that is AI. Some of you will have seen a bit of them as I prompted them into existence. And of course
									they needed branding and domain names before starting. Yes, I do have ASCII logos and URLs for said side projects… <span class="opacity-light">STØNK$¥, T1M3ZØN3D,</span> and
									<span class="opacity-light">(W)1CK3T5.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									The interesting thing with all these projects is they started as ideas to solve minor problems with tools<span class="opacity">/</span>sites I use. For example, my stocks are managed by Forsyth Barr and
									I don’t like their UI. No shame on them, it’s probably fine for a boomer. There’s just no ASCII and ticker… so I set about fixing that by making a scrolling ASCII stock ticker. That then led to some
									scope creep into a stock viewer for my portfolio!
								</p>
								<p>
									With some trial and error <span class="opacity-light">STØNK$¥</span> now runs locally and connects to an API of stock data. I can check how things are trending, see gains (and losses) converted into my
									local currency, and a portfolio summary. For now it’s still manual to add stocks (via updating a JSON file/schema). I like the idea of it being manual and complementary to the ASCII style.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can check <span class="opacity-light">STØNK$¥</span> out at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">http://localhost:8080</a> <span class="opacity-light">(jokes).</span> If you think I
									should finish it up <span class="opacity-light">(i.e. you would like use it and pay me money),</span> let me know!
								</p>
								<p>
									Next up was <span class="opacity-light">T1M3ZØN3D.</span> It’s pretty self explanatory: an ASCII map and a way for me to check the time for people I’m working with or to see when I can chat with friends
									overseas. There are so many time zone tools that I could have just used one of them, but nothing had the ASCII vibe I wanted. Needs a bit of polish like features to set your location and timezones you
									want to view. So far I’ve just hardcoded in New Zealand <span class="opacity-light">(and where friends, family, and clients are).</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									And lastly, I’ve struggled to make progress on my cricket app, <span class="opacity-light">(W)1CK3T5.</span> This was the main idea for a side project I wanted to work on. I’ve always thought there’s a
									huge opportunity to make a better version of <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com">ESPNCricInfo</a>. It’s a massive resource for cricket news, stats, commentary, and live scores. I just don’t need the
									bloat and want a simple ASCII version of the next fixtures, scores, and the Blackcaps <span class="opacity-light">(New Zealand)</span> team stats. The hard part has been getting the data I need.
									Compared to <span class="opacity-light">STØNK$¥</span> where there are numerous companies providing APIs to use, its a bit wild and confusing how I’m going to solve this. For now, where I’m headed is
									basically <a href="https://plaintextsports.com">Plain Text Sports</a> for cricket.
								</p>
								<p>As the year progressed, I got busier with work and all my vibe coded apps started to gather dust/bugs and fizzled out as I tried to spend more time outside with my camera…</p>

									With the absurd acceleration of AI, for the first time in ages I’ve felt like I needed a proper hobby away from a computer. Something creative, and something active. I’m already a collector of cameras,
									and love photography, so I decided to spend more time out exploring Wellington taking photos.
								</p>
								<p>
									Considering you can now prompt any scene into being, it also seemed even more timely to capture reality. What I see with my own eyes. Not AI. Not fake news. Just the beauty I find in what’s around me. I
									don’t travel much these days, so the nice benefit of getting back into photography around Wellington is seeing the city with fresh eyes after living here for many years. It’s also a chance to change the
									perspective and avoid all the bad news aka doom and gloom. The local economy is indeed bad, but there are moments of hope and charm around Wellington worth capturing and celebrating.
								</p>
								<p>
									To get back into “proper” photography I decided to retire my GF1 <span class="opacity-light">(an amazing camera I’ve had since 2010)</span> and I upgraded to a new
									<a href="https://www.fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x100vi/">FujiFilm X100VI</a>. I love it. It’s a fixed lens and perfect for taking everywhere with me, similar to the GF1 with a pancake lens.
								</p>
								<p>
									Despite my GF1 being 15 years old I took it out for one last wander around and ended up snapping one of my favourite photos. The shot <span class="opacity-light">(above)</span> of the Point Halswell
									Lighthouse as a storm was coming in. I got very lucky with the birds matching the checkered pattern.
								</p>
								<p>
									Using the GF1 for one more outing highlighted it’s not really about the tech specs of a camera, however, the X100VI has way better stabilisation and for the last few months I’ve been loving getting used
									to the built-in recipes and custom settings you can use to create film simulations.

									For now, I’m going to keep snapping and someday will put together an exhibition of my favourite prints. Until then, you can check out more of the photos I’ve been taking on my X100VI on
